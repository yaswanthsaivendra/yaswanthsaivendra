## 👋 Hello, I’m Yaswanth

### About
Most of the time, I’m a **full-stack developer**.  
Every now and then, I drop closer to the system layer and play with **network protocols, frames, and packets**.

I’ve built **web, mobile, desktop, and CLI applications** across:
- Data security & compliance
- EdTech
- FinTech
- GreenTech
- Healthcare

I prefer building **business-oriented problem solvers** over chasing virality or products that exploit human insecurities. Real constraints, real users, real value. I think in **first principles** and **systems**. Complex problems are best solved with simple, boring, reliable approaches.

### Current Work
- Working in the **greentech + fintech** space on **ESG reporting** and **green finance systems**
- Previously spent **1.5 years** building **data privacy & compliance solutions**, helping companies align with **India’s DPDP regulations**

---

### 2021–2024, In a three-year window, I:
- Freelanced with **8 clients**,  took part in **6 hackathons** and Completed **4 internships**
- Participated in **CTFs** and reported **4 P1** and **7 lower-priority** vulnerabilities as a security researcher

> If it moves data, enforces rules, or needs to survive real-world pressure, I’m interested.
